  "title": "How Tall Can A Human Get?: An Impartial Review by 2 Average Height Men",
  "description": "Two men of extremely adequate height discuss the upper limits of humanity's height potential. Not that it matters. Height is more a curiosity than a social necessity. There's nothing wrong with being not incredibly tall. Height is a spectrum. And we are on the highest point of the bell curve. So if you think about it... we're actually pretty \"up there.\" Which is a synonym for tall. So through the transitive property, one could say that we are tall.",
